Worked on porting the company's custom FPGA boards to virtualized
environments. As my task was completed quickly, I joined the hardware group
working on the company's new product line (MPCX), doing performance
evaluation at first as well as kernel developing for the board's interface
driver and the networking stack (Infiniband)
