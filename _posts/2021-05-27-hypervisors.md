I'm working on building a lightweight, ultra-performant hypervisor for x86 and
ARM architectures. Essentially, this is a research project inspired by <a
href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2019/EECS-2019-3.html">Serverless
Computing</a>, <a href="http://unikernel.org/">Unikernels</a> and modern
hypervisor design for low-power devices.

More information is available on our <a

2020 talk</a>.
