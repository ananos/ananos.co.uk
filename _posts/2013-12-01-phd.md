Efficient I/O Device Sharing in Virtualized Environments.<br/>As HPC applications scale to a large number of VMs, providing near-native network I/O performance to each peer VM is an important challenge. In this work, we present Xen2MX, a paravirtual interconnection framework, based on the Open-MX protocol, a port of the Myrinet/MX over generic Ethernet adapters. Experimental evaluation of our prototype implementation shows that Xen2MX is able to achieve nearly the same aw performance as Open-MX running in a non-virtualized environment.
