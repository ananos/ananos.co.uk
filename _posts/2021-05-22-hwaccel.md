Accelerating parts of an application can really boost performance. But is it
something we can easily do without being too intrusive to the application code?
Can we do that in the cloud? I'm working on getting (some of) these answers.

We are building <a href="https://vaccel.org">vAccel</a>, a framework that
abstracts hardware implementations of operations to functions. 

vAccel offers more predictable execution time than device passthrough, as all
the complicated software execution is pushed to the Host/Hypervisor. vAccel
ensures interoperability as it is hardware/vendor-agnostic by providing a
simple interface to add any acceleration framework.

More information about vAccel is available at <a
href="https://docs.vaccel.org">https://docs.vaccel.org</a>. Additionally,
aspects of the vAccel framework are presented at the following FOSDEM 2021
talks:
 * <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/vai_ml_lightweight_vmms/">ML inference acceleration for lightweight VMMs</a>
 * <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/microkernel_hardware_acceleration_for_unikernels/">Hardware acceleration for unikernels</a>
 * <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/containers_ml_kata/">ML inference acceleration on K8s using kata containers & AWS Firecracker</a>
